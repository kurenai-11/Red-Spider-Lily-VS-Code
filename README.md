## About this theme

As the name suggest, this theme is inspired by the red spider lily(flower) and my chuunibyo heart.

## Bugs or inconsistencies

I am creating this theme from scratch so there may be some bugs.
If you find any, you are free to open a new issue. Provide a code sample or a way to replicate seen behavior and I will look at what I can do to improve/fix it.
